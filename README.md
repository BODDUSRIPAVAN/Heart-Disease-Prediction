# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
    Cardiovascular(Heart) Diseases are the leading cause of death globally. Day by day these cases are increasing at a rapid rate. Prevention is better than cure. Predicting and preventing heart disease can save many lives. This project mainly focuses on predicting whether a person will be affected by heart disease in the future using Machine Learning algorithms based on some medical attributes. Several Machine Learning algorithms have been trained and tested. Among all the algorithms K-Nearest Neighbors showed a good accuracy of about 95.08% and recall of about 96.97%, which is outperforming the previously used models.
